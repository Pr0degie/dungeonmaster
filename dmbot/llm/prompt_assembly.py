"""Single owner of the DM system-prompt assembly order (ADR 034 family — pure helpers).

``orchestrator._build_request`` used to inline the string-join that layers the prompt slices.
That made the prompt ORDER an implementation detail buried in a method that also reads caches
and builds the Ollama request. This module extracts ONLY the final join into one pure,
order-explicit, testable function — it does not read or compute any slice itself; the caller
passes the already-resolved strings in.

Memory order per docs/conventions.md: persona (core+tone) → recap → JSON state →
who-plays-whom → history. (RAG hits sit between state and the alias hint here; history is added
by the caller, not by this function.)
